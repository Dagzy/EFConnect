Typos in 1.4  under configure method; list not being displayed properly for methods (1. repeat 1.)

--~~IN SECTION 1.5 DO WE NEED TO BE TARGETING A SPECIFIC FRAMEWORK WITH THE NEW CLASSLIB?!?!~~--
IT LOOKS LIKE WE NEED TO SPECIFY netcoreapp2 INSTEAD OF netcoreapp2.0; I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS

In module 2.0: clarify the creation of a directory; correct name of class to User;

Copy/Paste doesn't really work very well in module 2.0; has something to do with hidden characters carried over.

ConnectionString copy/paste is wrecked; starting to run into problems at the end of 2.0, using statements not annotated

Typos in 2.1
The <DotNetCliToolReference> xaml tag in module 2.1 is inaccurate as of .Net Core 2.1, it is tagged as <PackageReference>
with the rest of the nuget packages that are installed.

Typos in 2.2

2.3: Generate Field From Parameter is not an option. Choosing Initialize Field From Parameter provides a field, but
does not initialize using private member _ convention.

2.3- ctrl + . and interface implementation is left ambiguous

What is IAuthRepository referring to in 2.3?

2.4: Missing ctrl + . for using statements

2.5 Missing ctrl + . for using statements; typos
---------Initialize field from parameter is correct here----------
